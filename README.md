### Hi, I'm Sammy. My pronouns are It/Its.
 
I'm a catgirl doing all kinds of IT stuff.

I'm most experienced with the administration side of things, but also do lots of programming.

I love learning new things and trying out new technologies and all kinds of interesting stuff.

I have removed all of my personal repositories from Github. You can find them on https://git.cherrykitten.dev.
